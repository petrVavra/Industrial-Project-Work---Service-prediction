# Industrial-Project-Work---Service-prediction

Aim of this project is to predict a failure of belt in ```How is that damn thing called?```. 

This project is done by Petr VÃ¡vra and Cecilia Fili under direction of Thomas Schichl in course of Industrial Project Work at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria in Winter semester 2018/19.

#Sensors and actuators:

Rotary encoder - LPD-3086
Temperature sensor - DHT11? DS18B20?
Vibration sensor - 

#Architecture

Arduino1    --->
Arduino2    --->
.           --->        Raspberry PI        --->    PLC
.           --->
ArduinoX    --->

#Way to target:

* make sensors running with Arduino,
* set up a protocol communication protocol between Arduino and Raspberry Pi,
*
